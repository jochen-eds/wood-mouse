# Wood mouse density prediction

This repository includes training and test data as well as the final model from the publication: [XXX](XXX)

The model provided here allows the prediction of wood mouse densities in agricultural fields. The script [Example.R](Example.R) shows how to make such predictions. For information on development, use, and limitations, please see our associated publication.

The model was built using R version 4.3.1 and the packages tidyverse (version 2.0.0), ranger (version 0.17.0), caret (version 6.0-94), and yardstick (version 1.3.1).
